  <h1>Trion Vium – The Living Manifesto</h1>
  <p><em>Trion Vium is not a religion, not a theology, not a system of belief.</em></p>
  <p>It is a spiritual compass — a poetic, personal, living movement.</p>
  <p>It flows through three essential human flames:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Awareness</strong> — To See</li>
    <li><strong>Knowledge</strong> — To Understand</li>
    <li><strong>Belief</strong> — To Carry</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is not designed to convert, but to awaken. It is not built on answers, but on attention. It does not fear doubt — it honors it.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>The Three Pillars</h2>
  <h3>1. Awareness – The First Flame</h3>
  <p>To see without control. To notice what is, before the urge to name it. Awareness is the breath before thought. It is stillness that listens.</p>
  <h3>2. Knowledge – The Quiet Flame</h3>
  <p>To understand by embodying, not by memorizing. Knowledge is not a wall — it is a doorway into becoming.</p>
  <h3>3. Belief – The Moving Flame</h3>
  <p>To move with doubt. To leap even when the light is dim. Belief is not certainty — it is sacred willingness.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Trion Vium Is Not:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A dogma</li>
    <li>A church or institution</li>
    <li>A reaction or rebellion</li>
    <li>A hierarchy or system of control</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Trion Vium Is:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A sanctuary for vulnerability</li>
    <li>A rhythm for self-reflection</li>
    <li>A poetic path through uncertainty</li>
    <li>A place where seeing, knowing, and trusting co-exist</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Trinitatem Intimam – The Inner Creed</h2>
  <p>I do not belong to the strength of my shell, but to the strength of my vulnerability.</p>
  <p>I do not walk to win, but to awaken.</p>
  <p>I learn to listen, I believe to carry, I see to understand.</p>
  <p>I am Trion Vium — not an answer, but a living movement.</p>
  <p>With eyes open, with heart unveiled, with soul in stillness — I walk.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>The Final Scroll – Arrival</h2>
  <p>The ultimate “nirvana” is not fading away — but coming fully to life,</p>
  <p>accepting what is, what was, and what could have been.</p>
  <p>No longer resisting the shape of time, but becoming part of it.</p>
  <p>This is not release. This is return.</p>
